**INTRO**

A quiz game is an interactive game or application that tests a player's knowledge or understanding of a particular subject or topic. It typically presents a series of questions or challenges, and the player must respond correctly to score points or progress through the game.Some of the common features of a quiz game include:

Overall, quiz games aim to engage and challenge players while testing their knowledge or skills in a fun and interactive way!

The reasons why I choose to do a culture quiz Game are: to learn about different cultures by exploring customs, traditions, and history from around the world. To Test my knowledge by challenging yourself and others to see how much you know about various cultures.
lastly , to Promote cultural awareness by understanding and appreciation of diverse cultures.
