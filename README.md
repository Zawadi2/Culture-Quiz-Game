**INTRO**

A Culture Quiz game is an interactive game or application that tests a player's knowledge or understanding of different culctures. It presents a series of different culture questions, and the player must respond correctly to score points or progress through the game.I personally chose to do the Culture quiz Game because I am a ThirdCulture kid. I believe that Culture helps us to define who we are and where we come from. It brings people together, creating a sense of belonging and connection. Culture allows us to express ourselves through history, music, language,food and more. This Culture quiz will test the palyer knowledge by challenging yourself to see what do you really know about various cultures.
The main purpose of this game is to engage and challenge players while testing how culture they are in a fun and interactive way!

<li>Questions with multiple-choice answers</li>
<li>Scoring system to track player progress</li>
<li>Timer or time limit for all question</li>

**WHATâ€™S NEXT**

While I feel well above the minimum requirements for my quiz game, there are still a couple things I would like to improve to make the experience that much better.

Having had my husband and frineds test the game on a variety of devices, making sure the music plays andmaking sure the game can be played on iPhones, regardless of the browser used to access the website.
